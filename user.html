  <h1>Ouch! Zika Products </h1>

  <p> Our first product is our lotion/cream. We have two lotions based off your own preference. Our "Gooodmorning" cream has a stronger scent that screams "Energy!" It helps you get through your hot day.  Our "Goodnight" cream is more subtle and sweet. Many enjoy this cream because it does not have such a strong smell and it is soothing.

  <p>
    We used all natural ingredients, such as:
<ul>
    <li> Eucalyptus- A common oil that repels mosquitos</li>
    <li> Lavender- A sweet scent to go along with our products</li>
  </ul>
